This is my second project portfolio with React. However, this site is much more developed and advanced than my first project.

I referenced a site on Awwwards and created it completely by myself, adjusting it to my style and theme

With this project, I got into more complex css, where I:

- Worked with flexbox
- Added some colour transition animations, image effects
- ...

Overall, this is still a simple project so that I can continue to learn FE 
in-depth, it took quite a while. In this project, I hope to create a diverse responsive website.
